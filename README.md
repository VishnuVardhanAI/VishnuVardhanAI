# Hi👋 I'm Vishnu

I'm a software engineer specializing in backend development with Go.  
I have hands-on experience designing and building microservices, distributed backends, gRPC services, event-driven systems, and scalable storage workflows.

I also have a background in ML/analytics which helps me build data-aware systems and reason about performance, efficiency, and user behavior.

I’m passionate about writing clean, reliable, and maintainable backend code — and I’m always exploring new ways to push Go and cloud-native systems further.
