## Hi, I'm Vishnu 👋

I'm a software engineer specializing in backend development, distributed systems, and cloud-native architecture. I work with Go, Python, gRPC, PostgreSQL, Redis, NATS, RabbitMQ, Docker, and modern observability tools to build reliable and maintainable backend services.

My experience includes building and scaling production microservices at an e-commerce startup—where I led development of a promotion engine, migrated core services to Go, implemented distributed worker systems, and improved observability across the platform—as well as designing cloud storage systems, event-driven pipelines, and API-driven services in personal infrastructure projects.

I also have a background in data analytics and applied machine learning, with projects involving large-scale time-series forecasting (145K+ series) and customer segmentation for e-commerce.
