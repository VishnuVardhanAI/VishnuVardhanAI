# Hi, I'm Vishnu 👋

I'm a software engineer focused on building reliable, scalable backend systems in Go.  
I have experience designing microservices, building gRPC APIs, writing event-driven pipelines, and optimizing systems for performance and maintainability. I’ve worked on real-world projects involving distributed storage, background workers, API migrations, and production debugging.
 
I also bring a background in ML/analytics, which helps me design data-aligned systems and reason about performance and user behavior at a deeper level.

I care about clean architecture, good documentation, observability, and writing backend code that scales gracefully.
